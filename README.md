# Need Volunteer (Volunteer Management Website) - Client Side

## Overview

**Need Volunteer** is a user-friendly platform designed for volunteer management, allowing users to create, update, and delete volunteer need posts. Additionally, users can volunteer for others' posts. This project is built using the **MERN stack** and incorporates authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure data handling.

Through this project, I have learned and practiced:
- Securing APIs using **JWT (jsonwebtoken)**
- Implementing **Firebase Authentication**
- Navigating with **React Router**
- Creating APIs with **Express.js**
- Performing **CRUD operations** with **MongoDB**

## Key Features

- üîë **JWT Authentication & Authorization**
  - During login or sign-up, a **JWT token** is securely stored in the user's browser.
  - The token is removed upon logout.
  - Users **cannot access private routes or APIs** without a valid token.
  - Unauthorized attempts result in **automatic logout**.

- üîê **Data Security**
  - Users **cannot access other users' data** using their own JWT token.
  - Each user has an individual token stored in browser cookies.
  - Any unauthorized data access attempt results in **automatic logout**.

- üî• **Firebase Authentication**
  - Secure login and sign-up implementation.
  - Users can sign in with email/password or other Firebase-supported providers.

- üîç **Search & Filtering**
  - Users can search for specific volunteer posts.
  - A **visibility toggle** allows users to switch between **grid layout** and **table layout**.
